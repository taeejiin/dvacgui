# DVaCGUI

## bigger

### Introduction

This was my first ever coding project built the summer (2020) before my senior year of high school. Through this endeavor, I learned Python as well as its powerful libraries, iteration over data structures with pandas, data processing, debugging techniques, and much more. The code is definitely very scrappy and could be infinitely improved on, but as a first software project I am proud of it nonetheless. For the project, I developed, iterated, and tested DVaCGUI independently as a research intern for the Greer Group at Caltech. To understand materials theory, I was mentored by Rebecca Gallivan through our discussions of scientific papers, textboook passages, lectures and selected exercises.

### Short Description of DVaCGUI

The repo consists of the core self-containing code used in the earliest model of DVaCGUI, a proprietary graphical user interface that cleans raw nanoindentation CSV data, allows highly versatile calculations including burst behavior, energy dissipation, stress/strain/Sneddonâ€™s correction, stiffness, and is armed with simultaneous graphing capabilities supported in windows 10 OS+ and macOS X.
