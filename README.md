# DVaCGUI

## asdf

This was my first ever coding project built the summer (2020) before my senior year of high school. I developed, iterated, and tested DVaCGUI independently as a research intern for the Greer Group at Caltech. To understand materials theory, I was mentored by Rebecca Gallivan through our discussions of scientific papers, textboook passages, lectures and selected exercises

The repo consists of the core self-containing code used in the earliest model of DVaCGUI, a proprietary graphical user interface that cleans raw nanoindentation CSV data, allows highly versatile calculations including burst behavior, energy dissipation, stress/strain/Sneddonâ€™s correction, stiffness, and is armed with simultaneous graphing capabilities supported in windows 10 OS+ and macOS X.
